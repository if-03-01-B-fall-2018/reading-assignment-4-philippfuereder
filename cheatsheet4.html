	<h1>Box Model</h1>
	The CSS box model is essentially a box 
	that wraps around every HTML element.<br/> 
	It consists of: margins, borders, padding, 
	and the actual content<br/>
	<ul>
		<li>Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear</li>
		<li>Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</li>
		<li>Border - A border that goes around the padding and content</li>
		<li>Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</li>
	</ul><br/>
	<h1>Classes and Ids</h1>
	The HTML class attribute is used to define equal styles for elements with the same class name</br>
	So, all HTML elements with the same class attribute will have the same format and style</br>
	Here we have three "div" elements that point to the same class name</br>
	<br/>
	The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document)<br/>
	The id value can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for a unique element with the specified id value<br/>
	In CSS, to select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element<br/>
	<br/>

	<h1>Floating</h1>
	The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container</br>
	</br>
	The float property can have one of the following values:</br>
	<ul>
	<li>left - The element floats to the left of its container </li>
	<li>right- The element floats to the right of its container </li>
	<li>none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default </li>
	<li>inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent </li>
	</ul>
